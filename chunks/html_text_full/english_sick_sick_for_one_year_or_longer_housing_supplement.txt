Housing supplement
Housing supplement is money you can receive if you have activity compensation or sickness compensation and have housing costs. You do not need to pay tax on the supplement.
Am I eligible for housing supplement?
You can receive housing supplement if you live in Sweden, have activity compensation or sickness compensation and pay enough for your accommodation in relation to your income. You can also receive housing supplement if you live in Sweden and are receiving some form of disability benefit from another EEA country or Switzerland.
If you are 66 years or older and are receiving a full old-age pension, you apply for housing supplement from the Swedish Pensions Agency.
To find out whether you are eligible for housing supplement, you can call us at 
0771‑524 524
. Before calling, please prepare information about your housing costs, your income and your savings. If you are married or have a live-in partner, we need this information for both of you.

2. Apply
You can always apply for housing supplement up to three months back in time. If you want to apply for housing supplement for more than three months back in time, Försäkringskassan must have received your application no later than the month after the decision on your activity compensation or sickness compensation was made. Then you can apply from the same month that you were granted activity compensation or sickness compensation.
The application for housing supplement should be sent to Pensionsmyndigheten from the month you turn 66. If you are married or living with a partner that is 66 years old and receiving general pension, both of you shall apply with Pensionsmyndigheten.

3. Decision
If your application is complete, it will normally take 3 months before you receive a decision on housing supplement. In order for us to be able to take a decision on housing supplement, you must have received a decision on activity compensation or sickness compensation.
Usually you can receive housing supplement for as long as you receive activity compensation or sickness compensation. However, your housing supplement will not be automatically extended when you get a new decision on sickness compensation or activity compensation. Therefore, submit a new application for housing supplement if you want to continue to receive it.
