Calculate child support and create agreement document
        Calculation tool
    
            Takes about 15 minutes
        
For whom?
The tool is for parents who want to jointly calculate an amount for child support for shared children who live the majority of the time with one of the parents.
You cannot use the tool if you have several children together and they do not live together with one of you. You can instead book a web meeting to receive information from an administrator.
You cannot use the tool if the child or children live about the same amount of time with each parent (alternate residence).
How does it work?
Enter the child's costs and your own income and expenses. Save the information and send the link to the calculation to the other parent so they can enter their income and expenses. Naturally, you can also do the calculation yourself. But bear in mind that you need to know what income and expenses the other parent has to be able to calculate the right amount.
What do you get?
Once you both have filled in your information, you will get a suggestion of an amount for child support and an agreement template you can use to make a valid child support agreement.

Housing situation
This tool is for situations where the child/children live the majority of the time with one parent. This is the only situation in which the other parent is responsible for paying child support. If the child lives about an equal amount with both parents, then neither parent is obliged to pay child support.

Save/share the calculation
Here, you can create a link to the page that has your calculation. You can save the link, for example as a bookmark on your computer or phone, or e-mail it to someone you want to share the calculation with. The calculation can be accessed via the saved link for 2 years. This means that you can change the information in your calculation at any time during this period. Once you have changed information, save a link to the new calculation. The new link can then be accessed for 2 years from the date you saved it. An advantage of saving the link is that child support must be recalculated when the child gets older or if the situation of either of the parents changes, for example if either of you has a change in salary. When it is time to recalculate child support, you can follow the saved link and enter your current costs, income and expenses. This way, you do not need to start over and fill in all of the information again.

Tips on how to proceed
Create a written child support agreement. You can use the agreement template that
  
 is found in the tool.
Create a recurring bank transfer for the child support and mark the payment with the text “Child support”.
Remember to look over the agreement once the child gets older or your living situations change, e.g. if one of you has more children, gets a raise in income, or loses their job.
Deduction from child support for access
If you are the one paying child support and the child temporarily lives with you at least 6 days of the month or for 5 consecutive days, you can deduct 1/40 of the child support per day.
How to calculate the deduction
If your child support amount is SEK 2,500 and the child lives with you for one week (7 days), calculate the deduction as follows. 
1/40 x 2 500 = SEK 62.50
SEK 62.5 x 7= SEK 437.50
The deduction is rounded down. The next time you pay child support, you can deduct SEK 437.
You can only make a deduction from child support for access if you and the other parent have not already reached an agreement on child support with a recurring deduction per month, referred to as a net agreement.
