Report errors or benefit fraud
If you suspect that a person or company is receiving compensation that they are not entitled to, you can report this to Försäkringskassan. That will help us in our work against errors and benefit fraud.
We investigate all reports and file a police report if we suspect a criminal violation. Due to confidentiality, however, we cannot tell you who tipped us off what we come up with.
Use our e-service to report
You can report violations online, anonymously. Fill out the questionnaire to support our investigation. You can also attach documents that substantiate your information, such as excerpts from social media or an employer's certificate.
